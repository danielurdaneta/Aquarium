# Aquarium Project

The purpose of this project was to create a web application where the user can see month by month how our Aquarium evolved over time, the web app manages to go through a dataset and filter the following: general images, description of the month, title of the month, inhabitants photos and inhabitants description, by the other hand, our web app is screen size responsive and perform well in different devices. I did this by using CSS, HTML, JavaScript and its library D3.js
